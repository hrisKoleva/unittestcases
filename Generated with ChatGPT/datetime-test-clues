Test the current date and time: Ensure that the datetime object represents the current date and time accurately.

Test datetime conversion: Validate the correctness of converting strings to datetime objects and vice versa.

Test datetime arithmetic: Perform calculations involving datetime objects such as adding or subtracting days, hours, minutes, or seconds. Verify that the results are accurate.

Test datetime comparison: Compare two datetime objects and assert whether they are equal, greater than, or less than each other.

Test datetime formatting: Format datetime objects as strings using different formats. Verify that the formatted strings match the expected output.

Test leap year calculations: Check whether a given year is correctly identified as a leap year or not.

Test extracting components: Retrieve specific components from a datetime object, such as the year, month, day, hour, minute, or second. Verify that the values match the expected results.

Test timezone handling: Validate datetime operations in different time zones. Test conversions between time zones and ensure correct adjustments.

Test handling edge cases: Consider boundary cases, such as dates around the transition from one year to another, dates with different time zones, or dates close to daylight saving time changes.

Test datetime parsing: Ensure that parsing datetime strings with different formats produces the correct datetime objects.

Test handling invalid datetime values: Verify that appropriate exceptions or error handling mechanisms are in place when encountering invalid or malformed datetime inputs.

Test serialization and deserialization: Validate the process of serializing datetime objects into a persistent format (e.g., JSON or database) and deserializing them back into datetime objects.
